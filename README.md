## 🧩 About Me

I'm an innovative and dedicated software engineer focused on solving real-world problems through thoughtful system design, efficient code, and emerging tech like AI, security, and WebSockets. Whether it's crafting full-stack apps, diving into data compression, or tinkering with OpenCV, I'm always learning and building.

- 🔭 Currently working on: **WhisperLog** – a real-time chat app with voice, media, encryption, and performance optimization.
- 💡 Side quest: Learning **System Design**, **Data Compression**, and **Computer Vision with OpenCV**
- 🛡 Building my own **Signal-like secure messaging protocol** using E2E encryption, custom key exchange, and message integrity checks.
